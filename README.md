AWS EC2 Instance Terraform module
=================================

Terraform module which creates EC2 instance(s) on AWS.

This module can be used by either passing a "Config map" to the module or standard module variables
the reason to use the Config map option is to simplify the number of variables which need to be passed to the module and also opens up the possibility to using third party key/value stores (Consul) ie dynamically generate a map of key/values passing a map of variables to the module.

This module will eventually support bothe Windows and Linux operating systems as well as using Chef or Puppet as the configuration management system 

Usage
-----


Example using variables
```hcl
module "my_ec2_instance" {
  source = "https://github.com/NetworkBytes/tf-module-aws-vm"

  name  = "my-ec2"
  count = 1
  
  key_name               = "user1"
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["sg-12345678"]
  ...
}
```


Example using Config Map
```hcl
module "my_ec2_instance" {
  source = "https://github.com/NetworkBytes/tf-module-aws-vm"
  
  config = {
    name  = "my-ec2"
    count = 1
    ...
  }
}
```
